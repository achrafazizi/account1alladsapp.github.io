1- Sakura School Simulator Beginners Guide and Tips
Today we will be talking about a game that we ourselves can’t help coming back to. A Japanese game made by Garusoft Development Inc, Sakura School Simulator is the perfect game to take along when you will be in areas without WiFi or data. 


2- Making an NPC your lover
When you first start out and you have no money to buy a love potion, simply find your choice and talk to them until they allow you to hug them. Then simply spam hug while you compliment them until the status of the relationship is ranked as a lover. 

3- Earning money
You also don’t have to talk to NPCs to find money, simply exploring the town, you can find it just laying around. There is also money in the girl’s house, the boy’s house, and the little kid’s house. Keep an eye out while you’re flying around or you’re bound to miss it.
